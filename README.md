#motivation - a silly app to print random motivational quotes

I had an extra five minutes on my hands so I wrote a silly motivational quotes printer for my terminal.

Just add the path to the binary to your ~/.bash_profile to get a new motivational quote every time you open Bash!

Most motivational quotes provided via Shia LaBeouf. Shine on, you crazy diamond.
